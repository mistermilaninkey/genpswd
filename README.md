## üîë Simple Password Generator with GUI in Python üêç

This repository contains a simple password generator written in Python, using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). It allows you to quickly and conveniently create strong passwords of varying lengths, containing letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and symbols.

**Features:**

*   **Simple and Intuitive GUI:** Easy-to-use interface with a minimalist design.
*   **Customizable Password Length:** Ability to set the desired length of the generated password.
*   **Character Inclusion/Exclusion:**  Option to include or exclude letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and special symbols.
*   **Copy to Clipboard:**  Easy copying of the generated password to the clipboard with a single click.
*   **Robust Password Generator:** Uses Python's `secrets` module for generating cryptographically secure random passwords.

**How to Use:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**  `git clone https://github.com/mistermilaninkey/genpswd.git`
2.  **Install dependencies (if necessary):** In this case, Tkinter is usually included in Python's standard library. If you have issues, try reinstalling Python or using `pip install tkinter`. (on arch --- sudo pacman -S tk )
3.  **Run the application:** Navigate to the repository directory and run the script `genpswd.py` (or similar name) with the command:  `python3 genpswd.py`

**Example Usage:**

1.  Run the application.
2.  Enter the desired password length in the input field.
3.  Select which characters should be included in the password (letters, numbers, symbols).
4.  Click the "Generate" button.
5.  The generated password will be displayed in the output field.
6.  Click the "Copy" button to copy the password to the clipboard.

**Technologies:**

*   Python
*   Tkinter (GUI)
*   `secrets` module

**Project Goal:**

This project was created for:

*   Practice in Python development.
*   Learning to work with GUIs.
*   Creating a useful tool.

**Future Improvements (Possible):**

*   Adding the function to save passwords to a file (with encryption).
*   More advanced settings (e.g., excluding similar-looking characters).
*   Improving the interface design.
*   Adding tests.

**Contribution:**

Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas, improvements, or corrections, feel free to create Issues or Pull Requests.
